# back3nd 🎉

Welcome to the **back3nd** project! This is a super cool project that helps you manage files and data easily. Let's dive in! 🚀

## How to Install Dependencies 📦

First, we need to install some important stuff to make everything work. Just run this command:

```bash
bun install
```

## How to Run the Project 🏃‍♂️

Now, let's start the project and see it in action! Run this command:

```bash
bun run main.ts
```

## Environment Variables 🌍

To make everything work smoothly, we need to set up some environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```plaintext
STORAGE_REGION=your-storage-region
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=your-storage-endpoint
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

These variables help us connect to the storage service and manage files. It's like giving our project the keys to the storage room! 🗝️

## What's Inside? 🧐

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.38. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

### Special Features ✨

- **Better Auth**: This is a super cool tool that helps us authorize users to access PostgREST. It's like a security guard that makes sure only the right people can get in! 🛡️
- **File Management**: You can upload, list, and download files easily. It's like having your own personal cloud storage! ☁️
- **Swagger UI**: We use Swagger UI to make our API look nice and easy to use. It's like a map that shows you all the cool things you can do with our API! 🗺️

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Authorization**: We use `better-auth` to make sure only the right people can access our PostgREST. It's like having a secret password! 🔑
2. **File Service**: You can upload files, list them, and even download them. It's super easy and fun! 📂
3. **Swagger UI**: We use Swagger UI to show all the cool things you can do with our API. It's like a big menu of all the awesome features! 📜
